Comments on what I learned..
I ran the broken ThreadTwoHashMap couple times... and there sometimes comes out with an exception..
Based on the example below this occurs when exception happens.
I believe this is due to multiple threads running through the threadMap hashmap and one of the threads is trying to
start a thread that already started..
2 new threads (map size of 6 and map size of 8) are being introduced to run T0-7 when it is already being ran
The same single thread cannot be ran twice simultaneously.


multiple threads can run concurrently on multiple core system
with one core processor, only one thread may be ran at at time.
